# ðŸ’¼ CodTech Data Science Internship â€“ All Tasks

This repository contains solutions to all four tasks assigned as part of the **CodTech Data Science Internship**.

Each task demonstrates a different aspect of data science including data preprocessing, deep learning, deployment, and optimization.

## âœ… Task 1: Data Preprocessing Pipeline (ETL)

**Goal:** Create a pipeline to clean, encode, scale, and transform data.

- Language: Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
- Dataset: Titanic dataset
- Output: Cleaned CSV file `titanic_cleaned.csv`

## âœ… Task 2: Deep Learning Model (Image Classification)

**Goal:** Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

- Framework: TensorFlow + Keras
- Dataset: MNIST (loaded via Keras)
- Output: Model accuracy and evaluation

## âœ… Task 3: End-to-End ML Project with Deployment

**Goal:** Build a complete machine learning workflow from training to deployment using Flask.

- Task: Predict house prices using linear regression
- Dataset: Manually created house dataset
- Deployment: Flask API with `/predict` endpoint
- Input: JSON with area, bedrooms, and age

## âœ… Task 4: Business Optimization using PuLP

**Goal:** Maximize profit for a company using linear programming and constraints on labor and materials.

- Tool: PuLP (Linear Programming in Python)
- Problem: Decide how many units of Product A and B to make
- Output: Optimal production plan and maximum profit
